# NHERI GSoC Operations

[NHERI](http://designsafe-ci.org/) plans to apply to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as an umbrella organization.

[All projects/organizations supported by NHERI Facilities](http://designsafe-ci.org/) are eligible to participate in GSoC under the NHERI umbrella.

## NHERI Administrator for GSoC

The **organization administrators** are tasked with:

- Creating the initial application for NHERI to apply for GSoC.
- Advertising the application to **all** projects/organizations supported by NHERI.
- Managing NHERI's profile at GSoC.
- Requesting a minimum and maximum number of slots to accommodate the slots requested by each project/organization under NHERI umbrella.
- Maintaining contact with sub-org admins.

### How to Sign Up Mentors

Google forms can be used for mentor sign-up, providing a consolidated list of all mentors and their contact information. Mentors should be granted access to NHERI mentoring mailing list.

## Guidelines to Select Acceptable Student Proposals

**Note**: Slots are requested after the student submission phase ends.

**Sub Orgs** will decide on accepting/rejecting student proposals based on:

1. The number of slots received.
2. Whether the proposal already has at least one mentor.
3. The student's background and proposal quality.

**If** NHERI receives fewer slots than requested, the **organization administrators** will resolve slot allocation conflicts for each sub-org. We aim to assign at least one slot to each sub-org.

**Changes for 2022**

For 2022, GSoC has altered the rules for slot requests. We now need to provide a strict ranking of our proposals with the number of slot requests.

Each sub-organization will submit a tiered ranked list of student proposals they wish to accept, divided into 3 categories:

- **Tier 1**: Essential contributors we are eager to mentor.
- **Tier 2**: Highly desired contributors we would be happy to mentor.
- **Tier 3**: Additional contributors we would consider if enough slots are available.

Remember, you need enough mentors for all the contributors. Rank only those applications you have the capacity to mentor during the summer.

If requesting more than 3 slots, please distribute proposals across different tiers to ensure a balanced approach.
