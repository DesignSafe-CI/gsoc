# Google Summer of Code - NHERI Proposal Outcome

---

We regret to inform you that your proposal for the NHERI umbrella was not accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code. Despite the high quality of many applications, our resources and the limited number of slots provided by Google constrained us, leading to the rejection of several commendable proposals.

Your effort in submitting such a well-crafted proposal was greatly appreciated and contributed to raising the overall standard. We sincerely thank you for your time and dedication.

We hope this process has been a learning experience for you. We would be delighted to see your continued involvement with the projects under the NHERI umbrella. Your contributions, whether they be bug reports, participation in discussions, patches, or code, are highly valued. However, we also understand if your circumstances change and you pursue other opportunities during the summer.

Your engagement and discussions regarding your proposal were highly appreciated. If you choose to pursue your project independently, rest assured, you will likely find many in our community ready to offer support.

We encourage you to consider applying again next year. Experience shows that early and consistent involvement in a project significantly enhances the chances of acceptance. Should you plan to reapply, we recommend continuing your contributions to the project.

Thank you again for your efforts, and we wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.
