    TACC Tapipy, BRAILS, and Graph Network Simulators, which are central to modeling,
    analyzing, and understanding the impact of natural disasters.
    
    Our aspiration to join the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a strategic step towards
    enriching our ecosystem by integrating with a global community of developers,
    researchers, and students. GSoC offers a unique opportunity to engage with new
    talent who can bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and cutting-edge
    solutions to our tools and platforms. GSOC participation will accelerate the
    development of open-source software critical to our mission and inspire a new
    generation to contribute to science that makes a tangible difference in enhancing
    societal resilience against natural hazards.
    
    By aligning with GSoC, we aim to leverage this collaborative and educational program
    to bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications, thus
    furthering our impact on global safety and disaster mitigation efforts. We are
    excited about the prospect of mentoring bright minds and fostering contributions that
    can significantly advance our capabilities in predicting, preparing for, and responding
    to natural disasters. Our engagement in GSoC reflects our commitment to building a
    safer world through community-driven innovation and open science.

### What would your org consider to be a successful summer?

    For NHERI, a successful summer through our participation in GSoC encompasses more than technical advancements in our suite of open-source scientific tools. At the heart of our vision for success lies the goal of fostering a vibrant, inclusive community that welcomes and actively supports new contributors. Completing project milestones does not merely measure success for us but also the depth of engagement and the sustained involvement of these new contributors within our projects.

    A truly successful summer is one where we achieve significant strides in mentorship and knowledge sharing, thereby nurturing the next generation of experts in natural hazard engineering. We aim to empower these future specialists with the tools, skills, and community support necessary to drive forward our mission of mitigating the effects of natural disasters. By investing in the education and training of young talents, we envision contributing to a more resilient and sustainable future. In the future, our open-source tools and the surrounding community will be central to global disaster preparedness and response efforts.

    Therefore, our criteria for a successful summer include technological innovation and enhancements to our platforms, the growth of our community, and the fostering of an environment where learning and collaboration flourish. We believe that achieving these goals can amplify our impact and take meaningful steps toward building a safer, more resilient world.

### How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

    Our approach to ensuring sustained engagement between mentors and students centers on regular, structured interactions. We aim to facilitate setting realistic and achievable objectives for the Summer of Code projects and then closely monitor progress towards these goals. Our process involves tracking project milestones and fostering an environment of clear and effective communication between mentors and students, ensuring a consistent exchange of knowledge and expectations.
    
    Recognizing that each project may have unique operational strategies, we plan to accommodate these differences while providing overarching guidance and support. Our leadership team and project management staff will play a crucial role in GSoC, ensuring that the Summer of Code experience is positive and rewarding for the participants and results in tangible and valuable contributions to the projects. We will also offer training sessions to all our mentors to ensure all projects and students have the same experience through NHERI DesignSafe GSoC program. This dual focus on project outcomes and participant experience is critical to maintaining an active and productive mentor-student relationship throughout the program.

### How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

    At the core of our strategy to ensure timely project completion is the establishment of measurable, achievable goals coupled with clear, transparent expectations. This approach is pivotal for guaranteeing a mutually beneficial experience for both students and the projects within the Summer of Code program. We plan to conduct regular meetings with project leaders and students, providing a structured platform for addressing any challenges or roadblocks they may encounter. This proactive engagement aims to identify and resolve issues promptly, keeping the projects on track.

    For day-to-day monitoring and management of tasks, we will leverage tools like GitHub and Bugtrack, enabling efficient progress tracking and seamless communication among team members. We will also organize weekly cohort meetings of GSoC students on different projects within the NHERI umbrella organization to have a buddy-system for accountability and progress
    Additionally, we recognize the motivational power of community engagement and public recognition. To this end, we will offer students unique opportunities to showcase their work and progress to the broader open-source scientific and numeric computing community. These opportunities include presenting their ongoing work through webinars and use cases on designsafe-ci.org, featuring in our regular newsletter, and speaking engagements at relevant conferences. These platforms will incentivize students to adhere to their timelines and provide them with valuable exposure and feedback from the community, thereby enhancing their overall experience and commitment to their projects.

### How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

    The NHERI community includes more than 7000 members across the globe and is continuously expanding. We have an exciting array of conferences and symposiums scheduled. To immerse our students in this vibrant community, we will provide them opportunities to present their work at these events. We also organize hackathons over the summer and have an active Slack group, where GSoC students can participate and actively interact with the community. Additionally, we will facilitate connections to enable them to showcase their projects at other non-affiliated events, broadening their exposure and experience.

    Beyond these presentations, we are committed to integrating students into the heart of our community through regular progress updates. These updates allow students to share their journey and achievements with the broader community. We plan to actively promote these progress reports across various channels, including the NHERI newsletter and our Twitter feed. This approach fosters a sense of belonging among the students and keeps the community informed and engaged with the innovative work being done through the GSoC program. This active and multi-faceted involvement will enrich the students' GSoC experience and foster lasting connections within the NHERI community.

 ### How will you keep students involved in your community after GSoC?

    Our strategy for sustaining student engagement with the NHERI community beyond the GSoC program centers on providing ongoing opportunities for contribution and recognition. We plan to extend invitations to GSoC participants to present their completed projects at future conferences and meetups under the NHERI umbrella. This acknowledges their hard work and achievements and keeps them connected to the community and abreast of new developments and opportunities.

    Furthermore, the individual projects under NHERI each have vibrant, active communities of their own. These sub-communities have a successful track record of engaging volunteer contributors effectively. We will leverage this existing framework to encourage GSoC alums to continue their involvement, whether through contributing to ongoing projects, participating in community discussions, or mentoring future GSoC participants. This inclusive approach aims to foster a sense of belonging and ongoing commitment among the students, turning their GSoC experience into the start of a long-term engagement with our community. We organize an annual workshop on Natural Hazards Research and we plan to invite the students to participate in these conferences.
