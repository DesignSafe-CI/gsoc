## Your details

-   Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

    NHERI is dedicated to fostering the research and development of 
    open-source computing applications, facilitating open data sharing, 
    and providing computational resources for natural hazard engineering 
    research. We are actively involved in supporting prominent simulation 
    and AI/ML tools, including OpenSees, TACC Tapipy, BRAILS, and 
    Graph Network Simulators.

    Our intention to join the Google Summer of Code as an umbrella 
    organization aligns with our ongoing mission.
    By participating, we hope to provide our community a platform to 
    contribute to the advancement of vital open-source software and science 
    initiatives in building a safer world resilient to natural disasters.

-   What would your org consider to be a successful summer?

    As an umbrella organization representing NHERI's open-source scientific 
    tools, our vision of a successful summer extends beyond implementing 
    new features in our projects. Central to our success is cultivating a 
    sustainable, welcoming community that actively encourages and supports 
    new contributors. We gauge our success by these new contributors' 
    increased engagement and active participation in our projects. Furthermore, 
    a successful summer is marked by our ability to educate and train future 
    specialists in natural hazard mitigation. By doing so, we aim to contribute 
    to creating a resilient and sustainable future where our tools and the 
    community around them play a pivotal role.
    
-   How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

    10

-   How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

    Our approach to ensuring sustained engagement between mentors and students 
    centers on regular, structured interactions. We aim to facilitate setting 
    realistic and achievable objectives for the Summer of Code projects and 
    then closely monitor progress towards these goals. Our process involves 
    tracking project milestones and fostering an environment of clear and 
    effective communication between mentors and students, ensuring a consistent 
    exchange of knowledge and expectations.

    Recognizing that each project may have unique operational strategies, we plan to 
    honor these differences while providing overarching guidance and support. Our 
    board of directors and project management staff will play a crucial role in this, 
    ensuring that the Summer of Code experience is positive and rewarding for the 
    participants and results in tangible and valuable contributions to the projects. 
    This dual focus on project outcomes and participant experience is critical to 
    maintaining an active and productive mentor-student relationship throughout the program.

-   How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

    At the core of our strategy to ensure timely project completion is the establishment of measurable, achievable goals coupled with clear, transparent expectations. This approach is pivotal for guaranteeing a mutually beneficial experience for both students and the projects within the Summer of Code program. We plan to conduct regular meetings with project leaders and students, providing a structured platform for addressing any challenges or roadblocks they may encounter. This proactive engagement aims to identify and resolve issues promptly, keeping the projects on track.

    For day-to-day monitoring and management of tasks, we will leverage tools like GitHub and Bugtrack, enabling efficient progress tracking and seamless communication among team members.
    Additionally, we recognize the motivational power of community engagement and public recognition. To this end, we will offer students unique opportunities to showcase their work and progress to the broader open-source scientific and numeric computing community. These opportunities include presenting their ongoing work through webinars and use cases on designsafe-ci.org, featuring in our regular newsletter, and speaking engagements at relevant conferences. These platforms will incentivize students to adhere to their timelines and provide them with valuable exposure and feedback from the community, thereby enhancing their overall experience and commitment to their projects.

-   How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

    The NHERI community includes more than 7000 members across the globe and is continuously expanding. We have an exciting array of conferences and symposiums scheduled. To immerse our students in this vibrant community, we will provide them opportunities to present their work at these events. Additionally, we will facilitate connections to enable them to showcase their projects at other non-affiliated events, broadening their exposure and experience.

    Beyond these presentations, we are committed to integrating students into the heart of our community through regular progress updates. These updates allow students to share their journey and achievements with the broader community. We plan to actively promote these progress reports across various channels, including the NHERI newsletter and our Twitter feed. This approach fosters a sense of belonging among the students and keeps the community informed and engaged with the innovative work being done through the GSoC program. This active and multi-faceted involvement will enrich the students' GSoC experience and foster lasting connections within the NHERI community.

-   How will you keep students involved in your community after GSoC?

    Our strategy for sustaining student engagement with the NHERI community beyond the GSoC program centers on providing ongoing opportunities for contribution and recognition. We plan to extend invitations to GSoC participants to present their completed projects at future conferences and meetups under the NHERI umbrella. This acknowledges their hard work and achievements and keeps them connected to the community and abreast of new developments and opportunities.

    Furthermore, the individual projects under NHERI each have vibrant, active communities of their own. These sub-communities have a successful track record of engaging volunteer contributors effectively. We will leverage this existing framework to encourage GSoC alums to continue their involvement, whether through contributing to ongoing projects, participating in community discussions, or mentoring future GSoC participants. This inclusive approach aims to foster a sense of belonging and ongoing commitment among the students, turning their GSoC experience into the start of a long-term engagement with our community.
