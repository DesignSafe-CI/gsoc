# Mentor Summit

Each year, Google hosts a Summit for [**mentoring**] organizations. For NHERI, specifically, two (2) members are allowed to attend the Mentor Summit.

NHERI will nominate its Summit ambassadors as follows:

- The lead administrator for the current year.
- The lead administrator for the following year.

In the event the current lead administrator continues in their role the following year, another administrator may be invited by the lead administrator.

Mentors interested in attending the Summit, should the administrators be unavailable, are encouraged to email the lead administrator expressing their interest. The lead administrator will then have the discretion to select an attendee to represent NHERI at the Summit in their stead.
