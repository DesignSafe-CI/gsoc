## Organizations Eligible Under NHERI Umbrella

Eligible organizations include:

- [DesignSafe-CI](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/)
- [NHERI SimCenter](https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/)

Each organization must have a minimum of two mentors (**the sub-org admin can be one of the mentors**) who are committed to the full GSoC period.

Responsibilities of the sub-org administrator include communication with NHERI and promoting GSoC within their organization's community.

Organizations can register with us until the current year's application deadline or within 3 days after Google announces NHERI's participation as an umbrella org.

Upon registration, organizations should provide their preferred contact method and a link to their new contributor page, if available.

## Sub Org Administrators

Each project/organization under the NHERI umbrella for GSoC should appoint one administrator.

**Sub-org admins** are tasked with:

- Providing a list of project ideas to the **organization administrator**.
- Promoting the application within their respective project/organization.
- Registering mentors with NHERI.
- Connecting users with NHERI profiles.
- Requesting a minimum and maximum number of slots from the **organization administrator**.
- Assigning mentors and students to the available slots.
- Ensuring timely submission of evaluations for accepted projects.
- Encouraging community engagement with students in their projects.

## Mentors

If you wish to be a mentor, please inform your sub-org administrator. They will provide you with all necessary information for registration.

## Projects

Projects should be scoped to allow partial completion over the summer, ensuring student success in the final evaluation. Review the [student guide](), particularly our student requirements.

As a guideline, projects should be completable by a mentor in approximately one week of full-time work. This may seem brief, but students often require more time due to their need to familiarize themselves with the code and acquire substantial domain knowledge.

Each project must have at least one primary mentor and one backup mentor. A mentor may only be 'primary' for one student but can be a backup for multiple students. The sub-org admin may also serve as a mentor.

For project proposals, utilize our [proposal templates](https://github.com/DesignSafe-CI/gsoc/blob/main/templates/proposal.md). Publish your project ideas list here or link to an ideas list on your own website/repository.
